However, unlike a table in a relational database, a wide-column database defines columns per row. Therefore, each row in a wide-column database can contain a set of unique columns. Tables in a wide-column database can be split across multiple machines to support horizontal scaling.\n\nLet’s model the grades of our student application in a wide-column database.\n\n![Wide-column data model](./what-is-the-best-database/wide-column-model.png)\n*Wide-column data model*\n\n\nThe set of columns starting with “grades:” in this model is called a column family. This column family has separate columns for each student based on the classes they take.\n\nWhile we use this model for demonstration, a wide-column database is not the best database type for an application like a student database. A wide-column database is a good fit for data sets with variable parameter types. You may not often get such datasets in common business applications, but they do occur in scientific and engineering applications. Fault alarms in a telecommunication network, performance data in data center servers, and access logs in firewalls are some examples that will benefit from a wide-column database.\n\n[Apache Cassandra] is an open-source wide-column database and [Google Bigtable] is a wide-column database offered as a service from GCP.\n\nWide-column databases do not support SQL. But, some wide-column databases support a query interface named CQL (Cassandra Query Language). While CQL may look like SQL, it does not support JOIN operations. \n\n## Graph databases\n\nGraph databases excel at handling highly connected data sets. A graph database stores data as nodes and relationships making the relationships instantly available for queries.\n\nRelational databases handle connections via one-to-many or many-to-many relationships and JOIN operations. This may be efficient enough for first or second-degree connections but falls short beyond that. A graph database can effectively handle datasets with connections that extend beyond 20 or 30 degrees. \n\nAgain, let’s model our student dataset for a graph database.\n\n![Graph data model](./what-is-the-best-database/graph-model.png)\n*Graph data model*\n\nGraph databases are suitable for use cases like recommendation engines, access and user management systems, fraud detection systems, etc. \n\n[NebulaGraph] and [Neo4j] are open-source graph databases that are also available as cloud services. [Amazon Neptune] is a graph database service from AWS. \n\n## Time series \n\nA time series database is a specific type of NoSQL database optimized to store a series of metrics or events with a timestamp. It is also possible to use relational or document databases to store such data. But, time series datasets have some unique requirements like aggregating, archiving old data, etc., which cannot be effectively done with relational or document types of databases. Therefore, a purpose-built time series database is more efficient than other databases for storing time series data.\n\nA time series database stores data in columnar format, so it can split data across multiple servers to support horizontal scaling. It is a write-many-read-less type of database as data points in a time series database would be occurring continuously and need to be written to the database at the same rate. \n\nIt’s impossible to adopt a time series data model for a student database. So, let’s assume Hal and Roger are trying to record weather data from an IoT device.\n\nThe first device named dev-1, can measure relative humidity. So, we design the time series database with a single series with key “dev-1:humidity”.\n\n![Time series data model](./what-is-the-best-database/time-series-model-1.png)\n*Time series model - Single device.*\n\n\nSeveral days later Hal and Roger set up a new device dev-2 which can measure both humidity and temperature. So, we add two new series with keys “dev-2:humidity” and “dev-2:temperature”. \n\n![Time series data model](./what-is-the-best-database/time-series-model-2.png)\n*Time series model - Multiple devices.*\n\nThe beauty of the time series databases is that we do not have to mess with the existing data to add the new series. Also, this data model will easily scale to millions of devices. If newer devices come with more measurement capabilities we can quite efficiently incorporate those measurements as well.\n\n[Prometheus] and [Riak TS] are two popular open-source time series databases. [Influx DB] is an open-source time series database that is also available as a cloud service.\n\n## Search Engine\n\nSearch engine databases are purpose-built for searching textual contents. This is equivalent to an Internet search engine so it is named as a search engine database. A typical search engine database analyzes the text contents and creates indexes, similar to an index in a book. When a search is executed, the database can quickly find the mapping content via this index. \n\nSearch engine databases are helpful for full-text searching in news websites, blogs, software documentation, etc. Log file analysis is another important use case of search engine databases. Typical log files contain a textual description of a certain event or fault in a system. A search engine database can search and correlate log files from multiple sources to yield insightful results.\n\nAgain, a search engine database is by no means applicable for a student database. So, let’s assume that Hal and Roger are using a search engine database to index a set of documents on African wildlife.\n\n![Search engine database](./what-is-the-best-database/search-engine-database.png)\n*Search engine database.*\n\nThere can be an n number of documents. Since we are interested in wildlife, we are creating the index based on animals. Whenever a new document is added, the database will update the index. We can query the database using animal names, and quickly get the response containing the documents where the respective names are mentioned.\n\n[Apache Solr] is an open-source search engine database. [ElasticSearch] is another open-source search engine database that’s also available as a hosted service in AWS and GCP. [Algolia] is a  search engine database that is provided as a hosted solution.\n\n## Spatial\n\nNavigating digital maps has become a part of our everyday lifestyle. Digital maps are required to store and process spatial data that represents geographic locations on Earth. There is a series of standards defined in ISO/TC 211 for spatial data representations. These spatial datasets are stored in spatial databases. \n\nOften, a spatial database is a relational or a non-relational database, enhanced to store spatial data. [GeoMesa] is such a toolset that enables spatial data support in [Google Bigtable], [Cassandra], [HBase], etc. [Postgis] is also an open-source extension that adds the geospatial capability to [PostgreSQL].\n\nNavigation is the most common use case of digital maps. But, digital maps are used in other applications including civil engineering, telecommunication network planning, seismic surveys, etc. These spatial datasets in these maps need to contain information such as elevation, building infrastructure, soil condition, etc. Spatial databases with support for specific types of information will be required for these kinds of use cases. \n\n## Multi-model databases\n\nSome applications depend on multiple types of datasets so using one specific type of database is not efficient. As an example, a social media application may have one dataset that is best suited for a relational database and another dataset that requires features of a graph database. These applications are also called polyglot persistence applications. \n\nWhile they benefit from using different database technologies, using several databases leads to synchronization problems and operational overhead. Multi-model databases solve this problem by merging the flexibility of NoSQL and the features of relational databases. These databases support executing queries in relational or non-relational models. \n\nMost multi-model databases available today are extensions built on top of previous relational to NoSQL databases. An example is the JSON support added in [PostgreSQL]. [FaunaDB] is a multi-model database that is available as a service. [Couchbase], which is primarily a NoSQL database, offers many features of a relational database.\n\n# Choosing the right database\nA database is an integral part of any web, mobile or enterprise application, and most often is the limiting factor of scalability.\n\nOnce an application is in operation, swapping the database is no easy task. Therefore, you must ensure that you are choosing the best database right at the beginning.\n\nThe best database for your application is not necessarily the most scalable or the most popular database out there. Your use case determines the type of data you are working with and the scale. So, your use case is the most important factor for your decision about the database.\n\nNew technologies emerge, and create hype in the industry time to time. You may be tempted to select a database technology simply because it’s the hottest trend. The popularity of NoSQL databases in the recent past caused many developers to adopt them even for inappropriate use cases. \n\n<div class=\"inline-highlight\">\nAlways choose the database that suits your dataset and your application. Choosing a database just because it's the new trend is the worst thing you could do.\n</div>\n\nThere is no silver bullet in database management systems. Therefore, you must analyze your use case and select the best database that fits your needs and deliver your expected results. \n\n# Hype around NoSQL\n\nNoSQL databases have created lots of industry hype. NoSQL databases could be more scalable than relational databases due to their design. But, if your data model does not fit a NoSQL database, the scalability of NoSQL is not going to help you. Also, the fact that NoSQL databases are more scalable does not imply that relational databases are not scalable. The recent developments in relational databases have added various scaling features that we hope to discuss in some upcoming articles. \n\nAlways remember that a wrong design with the database will definitely impact your application launch. You do not want to miss your deadline just because you were messing with the most powerful database technology on the planet.\n\n[relational-model]: https://doi.org/10.1145%2F362384.362685\n[Riak KV]:
