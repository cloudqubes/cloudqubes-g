<div class="header-highlight">
Placing a reverse proxy in front of OpenStack is a sensible choice. Let's see why?
</div>

In a previous [post](/blog/setting-up-an-nginx-reverse-proxy-for-openstack/) we setup a reverse proxy with [NGINX], for talking to [OpenStack API] endpoints from our S-VNFMs. If we are to get our hands dirty in any type of API integration, especially with [OpenStack], troubleshooting is inevitable. 

Although [OpenStack] implement comprehensive logging features, those logs are usually distributed across different locations in OpenStack controller nodes, so our reverse proxy would serve as the ideal central location for collecting all API logs.

[NGINX] is equipped with a dedicated module, [ngx_http_log_module] for logging HTTP requests. With just two directives in NGINX config, we can start logging all our API requests.

## log_format
The `log_format` directive defines the format of the log file. It takes the form `log_format <format_name> format_string;`. Here's a sample configuration, which we include within the `http` context in the main configuration file `nginx.conf`.

```shell
log_format brief_log '$time_local, $remote_addr, $server_port, $request, status: $status;'

log_format detailed_log '$time_local, $remote_addr, $server_port, $request, status: $status, req_body: $request_body';
```

The `format_string` defines the format of the log file as a string. The strings proceeded by `$` are the variables in NGINX, and the available variables can be found at [log_format] and [variable_index] in NGINX documentation.

The `log_format` directive must always be included within the `http` context. 

## access_log

`access_log` defines where to write our log files. We can place this directive within `http` or `server` contexts. NGINX log files are written immediately after a request is processed, so what is placed in `server` context takes priority.

We are using a dummy python app, to test our logging function. The Python app is listening on port 5000 and we have configured 5001 as the reverse proxy port.

```shell
#python app
server{
    listen 5001;
    client_max_body_size 0;
    
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access_myapp.log detailed_log;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000;
    }
}
```

Use curl to issue HTTP request:

```shell
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5001/long_request -d '""param1": "value"'
```

Check the log file:

```shell
$ cat /var/log/nginx/access_myapp.log
05/Feb/2020:13:46:27 +0000, 127.0.0.1, 5001, POST /long_request HTTP/1.1, status: 200, req_body: \x22\x22param1\x22: \x22value\x22
```

You may notice that that `x22` (unicode value) is used to escape the quotation mark in `json`. For OpenStack APIs with a lot of parameters in `json` format, this will make the log files look cluttered.

So, we will update the `log_format` as below.

```shell
log_format detailed_log escape=none '$time_local, $remote_addr, $server_port, $request, status: $status, req_body: $request_body';
```

Make a new HTTP request with `curl`, and check the log file. The `json` parameters will be written to the log with the quotation marks, making it more readable.

```shell
$ cat /var/log/nginx/access_myapp.log
05/Feb/2020:13:46:27 +0000, 127.0.0.1, 5001, POST /long_request HTTP/1.1, status: 200, req_body: \x22\x22param1\x22: \x22value\x22
05/Feb/2020:13:54:49 +0000, 127.0.0.1, 5001, POST /long_request HTTP/1.1, status: 200, req_body: ""param1": "value""
```

In this post we tested the logging function in [NGINX] server, with a dummy Python app. The same concepts can be applied to enable logging for [OpenStack reverse proxy]((/blog/setting-up-an-nginx-reverse-proxy-for-openstack/)), which we hope, will make life easier for you in the NFV journey.
