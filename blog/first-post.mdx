[Kubernetes ingress] is a mechanism for exposing applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster via HTTP or HTTPS.


This is a simple representation of Kubernetes ingress. To learn how ingress works, you can read up on [Kubenetes ingress vs ingress controller](/blog/my-third-post)




[NodePort] or [LoadBalancer] Services also can expose an application running inside a cluster. But, both [NodePort] and [LoadBalancer] Services work in layer-3 in the OSI model.

Ingress works with HTTP protocol in layer-7 so offers more flexibility for HTTP-based applications. Also, ingress does not have some of the limitations in [NodePort] or [LoadBalancer] Services. 

So, ingress should be your preferred way for exposing HTTP applications inside a Kubernetes cluster to external clients.

An ingress defines a set of rules for routing HTTP traffic. You can use these rules to manipulate HTTP requests. 

Let's check out three such usecases of ingress rules for handling HTTP traffic.
