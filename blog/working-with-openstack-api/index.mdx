<div class="header-highlight">
OpenStack API could be a bit daunting at the beginning. So, let's deal with that.**
</div>

All OpenStack services expose their capabilities via RESTful APIs, that can be consumed by client applications. In fact, the OpenStack CLI and Horizon GUI are also client applications that rely on these APIs.

Integration with OpenStack API is an important part of onboarding a VNF, which is accompanied by an S-VNFM, so that awareness of this API could ensure a smooth onboarding process.

So, let's explore the OpenStack API, using [curl] which is a useful tool for interacting with HTTP APIs. While `curl` has a multitude of options, we will be using only two of them during this exercise; the `-i` option to print the response headers to the output, and `-X` to specify the HTTP command such as `GET` or `POST`.

Before proceeding further, we have to be familiar with OpenStack service endpoints.

# Endpoints

The URL of a webservice, is called its endpoint. The endpoints of OpenStack services can be listed in CLI. 

```shell
$ openstack endpoint list
+----------------------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
| ID                               | Region    | Service Name | Service Type   | Enabled | Interface | URL                                             |
+----------------------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
| 03fd6f94e5494775a131fa20d8a6bcce | RegionOne | cinder       | block-storage  | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/volume/v3/$(project_id)s  |
| 24ee3add77f84c70957a898c14cb8211 | RegionOne | nova_legacy  | compute_legacy | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/compute/v2/$(project_id)s |
| 28ec759c82914be4962ec8bc41de311c | RegionOne | nova         | compute        | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/compute/v2.1              |
| 2968d593668b4fe7a781e86b82c388c1 | RegionOne | neutron      | network        | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5:9696/                     |
| 33fefc7fd11c4c998cda9259c9fe854e | RegionOne | keystone     | identity       | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/identity                  |
| b5d01570efd249ae9118853f1ef008aa | RegionOne | cinderv3     | volumev3       | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/volume/v3/$(project_id)s  |
| d3bdbe66cf0f4019a0f4d1fdbc7e359c | RegionOne | keystone     | identity       | True    | admin     | http://10.10.10.5/identity                  |
| db5af25d61c443e2b0f06652b4563f7c | RegionOne | placement    | placement      | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/placement                 |
| ddc7d363959b4eaa836d91e650a52dae | RegionOne | cinderv2     | volumev2       | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/volume/v2/$(project_id)s  |
| f6b7ae1203e74ffca3bac6efbdaed8eb | RegionOne | glance       | image          | True    | public    | http://10.10.10.5/image                     |
+----------------------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------+---------+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+
```

Above is the endpoints listing in a DevStack installation, and could be different from that of a production deployment where each endpoint will have a dedicated port.

The endpoint is the root URL of the service, and the URL for sending each API request could be formed by concatenating it with the relative path mentioned in [API specs][api_spec].


# Keystone

[Keystone], which impelements the authentication and service discvery, should be the first point of contact when working with OpenStack API. Keystone has two API versions; v2 and v3. It is recommended to use [v3 version] for all new deployments, since v2 would be [deprecated and may be dropped eventually][keystone_v2].

## Authentication

Keystone supports multiple authentication mechanisms such as username/password, LDAP, and OAuth. Saving other authentication methods to a later discussion, let's stick to username/password authentication.

```shell
curl -i -X POST http://10.10.10.5/identity/v3/auth/tokens -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '
{
    "auth": {
        "identity": {
            "methods": [
                "password"
            ],
            "password": {
                "user": {
                    "domain": {
                        "id": "default"
                    },
                    "name": "admin",
                    "password": "secret"
                }
            }
        },
        "scope": {
            "project": {
                "domain": {
                    "id": "default"
                },
                "name": "demo"
            }
        }
    }
}
'
```

This is the [authentication with scoped authorization][scoped], which means that authorizatoin is scoped to the project named `demo`.

If authentication is successful Keystone responds with a token in header parameter `X-Subject-Token`. This token has to be provided in 'X-Auth-Token' header parameter of subsequent API requests.

Since the authentication token is very long and incovenient to copy/paste around, let's save the value to an environment variable, and refer that in following requests.

```shell
export OS_TOKEN="<authentication token>"
```


## Service Discovery

Service discovery feature ease the work of maintaining the endpoint information at the client application, by providing a service catalog at the time of authentication. The service catalog is an array of endpoints, which are authorized for a particular client.

A service catalog will be always provided in the response of [authentication with scoped authorization][scoped]. It is recommended for the client applications to use this catalog instead of hardcoding the URLs.of individual services.

# Nova

All VM related actions can be accomplished via [Nova API]. 

List VMs.
```shell
curl -i -X GET http://10.10.10.5/compute/v2.1/servers -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN"
```

Create VM.
```shell
curl -i -X POST http://10.10.10.5/compute/v2.1/servers -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN" -d '
{
    "server": {
        "name": "vm_1",
        "imageRef": "5f1c338f-5b36-4dc7-b035-64210f427fa9",
        "flavorRef": "1",
        "networks": [{
            "uuid": "2520ceab-b3d5-4ee9-873a-cbc40f84aaa5"
        }]
    }
}'

```


# Neutron

[Neutron API] implements all feature for managing virtual networks and ports.

List all networks.
```shell
curl -i -X GET http://10.10.10.5:9696/v2.0/networks -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN"
```

We can also use filters to limit the results.
```shell
curl -i -X GET http://10.199.254.221:9696/v2.0/networks?name=private -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN" 
```

Create network:
```shell
curl -i -X POST http://10.10.10.5:9696/v2.0/networks -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Auth-Token: $OS_TOKEN" -d '
{
    "network": {
        "name": "sample_network",
        "admin_state_up": true,
        "mtu": 1400
    }
}'
```

While we have demonstrated only a limited number of operations and features in OpenStack APIs, you could check the [documentation][api_spec] for the complete reference. Once you grab the basic concepts, working with the API of any service should be fairly easy since they all follow a similar pattern.

In a future post we hope to explore more about other authentication options available in [Keystone].
