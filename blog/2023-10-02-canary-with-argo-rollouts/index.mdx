The canary deployment strategy gradually rolls out a new software version on Kubernetes by splitting up the traffic between the new version and the stable version already in production.

With the help of an ingress controller, we can [manually do a canary deployment](https://cloudqubes.com/blog/canary-deployments-with-ingress-nginx/) in three steps.

1. Create a Kubernetes Deployment, Service, and an Ingress to route traffic to the Deployment.
2. Create a new Deployment (scaled-down) with the new version and create the canary Ingress that defines the traffic split.
4. Gradually increase the traffic percentage to the new Deployment while scaling the new Deployment to match the traffic.

This is a bit of manual work. Not practical in a production setup that rolls out changes multiple times a day.
 
For such production use cases we can use Argo Rollouts to automate canary deployments.

# What is Argo Rollouts

[Argo Rollouts](https://argoproj.github.io/rollouts) is an open-source Kubernetes controller that automates Kubernetes progressive delivery strategies such as canary and blue-green deployments.

Argo Rollouts is a part of the [Argo Project](https://argoproj.github.io) - a [CNCF graduated project](https://www.cncf.io/projects/argo/) that develops four premier cloud-native tools including Argo Rollouts.


# How Argo Rollout works

Argo Rollout implements **Rollouts** - a Custom Resource Definition which substitutes the `Deployment` object in a canary deployment strategy.

A Rollout object can hold one or more revisions.

![Argo Rollout Custom Resource Definition](./argo-rollouts-object.png)

A revision is a ReplicaSet. 

When creating a new Rollout object, Argo creates `revsion:1` which is the production ReplicaSet.

To roll out the a new version, Argo Rollouts creates a new revision (canary ReplicaSet) and uses the ingress controller to route a percentage of the traffic to the canary.

![Rollout, revision:1 and revision:2 with 10% traffic routed to canary.](./argo-rollouts-object-1.png)

The Rollout object defines several steps that gradually increase the traffic portion to the canary.

![Rollout, revision:1 and revision:2 with traffic percentage to canary increased up to 30%.](./argo-rollouts-object-2.png)

Following the steps Argo Rollouts complete the canary deployment by migrating 100% of the traffic to the new version. At this point, Argo Rollouts scales down the `revsion:1` ReplicaSet to zero Pods.

# Installing Argo Rollouts

You can easily install Argo Rollouts in your Kubernetes cluster by using the manifest from [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases). As a best practice, install Argo Rollouts in a dedicated namespace `argo-rollouts`.

```shell
kubectl create namespace argo-rollouts
kubectl apply -n argo-rollouts -f https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/install.yaml
```

We also need the Argo Rollouts kubectl plugin.

```shell
curl -LO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-rollouts/releases/latest/download/kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64
sudo mv ./kubectl-argo-rollouts-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/kubectl-argo-rollouts
```

Verify the plugin installation.
```shell
kubectl argo rollouts version
```

```shell
kubectl-argo-rollouts: v1.6.0+7eae71e
  BuildDate: 2023-09-06T18:36:42Z

```

# Installing an Ingress Controller

Argo Rollouts depends on the ingress controller for traffic splitting between the canary and the stable. So, you need an ingress controller that can interwork with Argo Rollouts. 

We are using [Ingress Ngingx controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) in our setup. 

You can also use other [supported ingress controllers](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/traffic-management/) like [Ambassador](https://www.getambassador.io/products/edge-stack/), [Istio](https://istio.io/), etc.

Please refer the documentation of your ingress controller on how to set it up.

# Deploying the application

`cube-root`, a microservice in [number-crunch](https://github.com/cloudqubes/number-crunch-2) calculates the cubic root of a number.

We are going to upgrade `cube-root` from version `2.0.1` to `3.0.1` with Argo Rollouts using canary deployment. 

Create the `cube-root-rollout.yml` - the Kubernetes manifest for creating the Rollout object for `cube-root`.

```yaml
# cube-root-rollout.yml

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Rollout
metadata:
  name: cube-root
spec:
  replicas: 10
  strategy:
    canary:
      canaryService: cube-root-canary
      stableService: cube-root-stable
      trafficRouting:
        nginx:
          stableIngress: cube-root
      steps:
      - setWeight: 10
      - pause: {}
      - setWeight: 20
      - pause: {duration: 60}
      - setWeight: 40
      - pause: {duration: 60}
      - setWeight: 80
      - pause: {duration: 60}
  revisionHistoryLimit: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cube-root
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cube-root
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cube-root
        image: cloudqubes/cube-root:2.0.1
        ports:
        - name: http
          containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

We are using version `2.0.1` of `cube-root` in this Rollout.

Under the `trafficRouting` directive we specify `nginx` as our Ingress Controller. If you are using a different Ingress Controller make sure to substitute the appropriate value here.

`Steps` define the series of steps for performing this canary deployment.

In the first step, we route 10% of the traffic to the canary. Then `pause: {}` instructs Argo Rollouts to pause the rollout until further input.

We incrementally increase the traffic percentage to the canary in the subsequent steps. At each step, we pause the rollout for 60 seconds as indicated by `pause: {duration: 60}`. We can use this time to monitor the performance of the new version and roll back if there is a problem.

The `canaryService` and `stableService` directives refer to two Kubernetes Services that route traffic to the canary and stable ReplicaSets respectively. 


Let's create the rollout.
```shell
kubectl apply -f cube-root-rollout.yaml 
```

Check the status of the rollout.
```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout cube-root
```

```shell
Name:            cube-root
Namespace:       default
Status:          ✖ Degraded
Message:         InvalidSpec: The Rollout "cube-root" is invalid: spec.strategy.canary.stableService: Invalid value: "cube-root-stable": service "cube-root-stable" not found
Strategy:        Canary
  Step:          
  SetWeight:     10
  ActualWeight:  0
Replicas:
  Desired:       10
  Current:       0
  Updated:       0
  Ready:         0
  Available:     0

NAME         KIND     STATUS      AGE  INFO
⟳ cube-root  Rollout  ✖ Degraded  42s  
```
The Rollout is in `Degraded` state because the Services `cube-root-stable` and `cube-root-canary` are not created yet.

## Creating the Kubernetes Services

Create the manifest `cube-root-service.yml` for the two Services.
```yaml
# cube-root-service.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cube-root-stable
spec:
  selector:
    app: cube-root
  ports:
  - name: cube-root-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080

---

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: cube-root-canary
spec:
  selector:
    app: cube-root
  ports:
  - name: cube-root-port
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
```

We use the same selector `app: cube-root` in both Services. Later, we'll see how Argo Rollouts add another selector to the Services for routing traffic to the canary ReplicaSet.

Create the Services.
```shell
kubectl apply -f cube-root-service.yml
```

Check the Services.
```shell
kubectl get services -o wide
```

```shell
NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE   SELECTOR
cube-root-canary   ClusterIP   10.99.114.119   <none>        8080/TCP   33s   app=cube-root
cube-root-stable   ClusterIP   10.96.61.88     <none>        8080/TCP   33s   app=cube-root
```

Check the status of the Rollout.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout cube-root
```

```shell
Name:            cube-root
Namespace:       default
Status:          ✖ Degraded
Message:         InvalidSpec: The Rollout "cube-root" is invalid: spec.strategy.canary.trafficRouting.nginx.stableIngress: Invalid value: "cube-root": ingress.networking.k8s.io "cube-root" not found
Strategy:        Canary
  Step:          
  SetWeight:     10
  ActualWeight:  0
Replicas:
  Desired:       10
  Current:       0
  Updated:       0
  Ready:         0
  Available:     0

NAME         KIND     STATUS      AGE    INFO
⟳ cube-root  Rollout  ✖ Degraded  5m23s  
```

Still, the Rollout is in `Degraded` state because the ingress `cube-root` is not yet available.

## Creating the Ingress
Create the manifest for `cube-root` Ingress.

```shell
# cube-root-ingress.yml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: cube-root
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: cube-root-stable
            port:
              number: 8080
```

This ingress routes traffic to the `cube-root-stable` Service.

Argo will take care of creating a corresponding Ingress resource for routing traffic to the `cube-root-canary` Service.

Create `cube-root` Ingress.
```shell
kubectl apply -f cube-root-ingress.yml
```

Check Ingress resources.

```shell
kubectl get ingress
```

```shell
NAME                         CLASS   HOSTS   ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
cube-root                    nginx   *                 80      6s
cube-root-cube-root-canary   nginx   *                 80      6s
```

The first Ingress, `cube-root` is what we created with the manifetst `cube-root-ingress.yml`. 

Argo Rollouts has created the second Ingress `cube-root-cube-root-canary`. Let's check its details.

```shell
kubectl describe ingress cube-root-cube-root-canary
```

```shell

```
This Ingress uses `cube-root-canary` Service as the backend. But, the `canary-weight` is set to zero indicating that no traffic is routed to the canary Service yet.

Check the status of the Rollout.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout cube-root
```

```shell

```

We have 10 Pods running with image `cloudqubes/cube-root:2.0.1`.

Argo has also created the corresponding ReplicaSet for `revision:1`.

```shell
kubectl get replicasets
```

```shell

```



## Testing cube-root application

Create the `test.sh` file with this script for testing `cube-root`. Use the correct IP address for your Ingress resource.
```shell
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..20}
do
  echo -n $i: 
  curl http://192.168.49.2/cube-root/8
done
```

Run the test.
```shell
./test.sh
```

```shell
1:{"Version":"v2","InputNumber":8,"CubeRoot":2}
2:{"Version":"v2","InputNumber":8,"CubeRoot":2}

```

We get 20 responses from the `v2` version of `cube-root`

# Rolling out the new version

In the `cube-root-rollout.yml` update the image to `3.0.1`.

```shell
        image: cloudqubes/cube-root:3.0.1
```

Apply the changes and check the status of the Rollout.

```shell
kubectl apply -f cube-root-rollout.yml
```

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout cube-root

`revision:2` is created with one Pod.

The upgrade status is `Paused` since we defined the first step to `pause` in the `cube-root-rollout.yml` manifest.

Check the Services.
```shell
kubectl get services -o wide
```

```shell

```

Argo has added a new selector `rollouts-pod-template-hash` to each Service for routing traffic to the canary and the stable versions. Also, Argo has created a new ReplicaSet for the canary.

```shell
kubectl get replicasets -o wide
```

Argo has updated the canary ingress to send 10% of the traffic to the canary version.

Test the application with the test script.

```shell
./test.sh 
```

```shell

```

Three responses are from the new version `v3`. 

Since `v3` is working fine, we can proceed to the next step.

# Promote the rollout

The `cube-root` Rollout is now in paused status. We must `promote` it for the progressive delivery to continue.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts promote cube-root
```

Now the delivery will continue as we have defined under the `steps` directive in the `cube-root-rollout.yml`

```shell
#steps in cube-root-rollout.yml
      steps:
      - setWeight: 10
      - pause: {}
      - setWeight: 20
      - pause: {duration: 60}
      - setWeight: 40
      - pause: {duration: 60}
      - setWeight: 80
      - pause: {duration: 60}
```

The Rollout is now in `paused` state in the 3rd step.

```shell
kubectl argo rollouts get rollout cube-root
```

Now we have a total of 18 Pods with 8 Pods in `revision:2`.

Test the application.

```shell
./test.sh
```

```shell

`v3` serves most of our requests now. Since `v3` is working fine we do not have to roll back but can continue the rollout.

The new version has become the stable.
And we are ready to roll out the next release.

# Wrapping up

Earlier, we did a [canary deployment manually](https://cloudqubes.com/blog/canary-deployments-with-ingress-nginx/). 

Now, we automated a major part of it with Argo Rollouts.

But we still have some manual work - monitoring - which we did with `curl`. We can automate this part using Prometheus which we will soon do.

Argo Rollouts also supports blue-green deployment which is another popular progressive delivery strategy. Let's get into that next.
