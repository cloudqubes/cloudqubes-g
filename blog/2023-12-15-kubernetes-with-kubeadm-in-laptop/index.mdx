In this 

Having access to a Kubernetes test lab can make your life easier. While there are several Kubernetes distributions optimized to run on resoirce contrained hardware like a latop. But there Kubernetes distributions do not exactly resemple a production Kubernetes deployment. 

But you can have a vanilla Kubernetes cluster right on your laptop if it has memory of 6G+. This works on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

# What

# 

# start chainsaw edit from here
Test labs are an essential part of a the life of DevOps practiotoiners. Test labd help you try out things upskill yourself and verify things before moving to production. A Kubernetes test lab does not always require high performance servers. You can set up a vanilla Kubernetes test lab in your laptop easily with kubeadm.

# Why use kubeadm

Deploying a Kubernetes cluster with `kubeadm` involves a bit of work as you will see below. There are certainly otherways to run a Kubernetes cluster on your laptop. Then why bother with kubeadm.

1. kubeadm creates a Kubernetes cluster that confirms to teh Kubernetes confirmacne tests
2. Learning purpose - You get to understand the components and how they work
3. Closely reseble your production Kubernetes - Resource optimized Kubernetes distributions like Minikube often bundles certain components together, so will deviate from a production Kubernetes cluster

In this tutorial we will deploy a Kubernetes cluster in a latop computer. You need a laptop computer with 6GB+ memory and at least 4 CPU cores. We will deploy the Kubernetes cluster on an Ubuntu virtual machine running on this laptop. To lauch an Ubuntu Virtual machine we use Multipass. Multipass is a tool to launch Ubuntu VMs on Linux, macOS or Windows. It works on x86 and ARM architecture so you can use Multipass on the latest Apple Silicon Macs or event on a Raspberry Pi.

# Install Multipass

Install Multipass following the installation instructions for your platform. 

Launch a virtual machine using the latest LTS version of Ubuntu.
```shell
$ multipass launch -d 5G -m 2G -c 2 -n k8s30 22.04
```

This VM will be our host for the Kubernetes cluster.

# Prepare the host

A Pod in a container cluster is assigned an IP address that is different from the host IP address. To support IP routing to a Pod, the host must satisfy two requirements.

1. Allow IPv4 forwarding.
2. Let iptables see bridged traffic

So, we enable them in the host.

## Load the kernel modules

Load the kernel modules `br_netfilter` and `overlay.`

```shell{outputLines: 2}
sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf > /dev/null <<EOT
overlay
br_netfilter
EOT
```

Load the modules.
```shell{outputLines: 5}
sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
```

Verify the modules are loaded.
```shell{outputLines: 2, 4-5}
lsmod | grep overlay
overlay               155648  0
lsmod | grep br_netfilter
br_netfilter           32768  0
bridge                352256  1 br_netfilter
```


Configuer the `sysctl` parameters.
```shell
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf > /dev/null <<EOT
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOT
```

Apply the sysctl configurations.

```shell{outputLines: 2}
sudo sysctl --system
```

# Install containerd

We use [containerd](https://containerd.io/) as the container runtime in our Kubernetes cluster. The containerd project [releases]((https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases)) binaries for both x86 and arm architectures.

Downlolad the latest version which is `1.7.11` at the time of this writing.

For ARM architecture (if you are on Apple Silicon or RaspberryPi).

```shell
wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v1.7.11/containerd-1.7.11-linux-arm64.tar.gz
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local containerd-1.7.11-linux-arm64.tar.gz
```

For amd64 architecture.

```shell
wget https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/download/v1.7.11/containerd-1.7.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar Cxzvf /usr/local containerd-1.7.11-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Run containerd as a service.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/containerd/containerd/main/containerd.service
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/systemd/system
sudo cp containerd.service /usr/local/lib/systemd/system
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
```

Check the status of `containerd` service.

```shell
sudo systemctl status containerd
```
If the `containerd` is in `active` state, proceed to the next section.

##  Install runc

containerd depends on `runc` for spawning containers. Let's install `runc` now. `runc` project binaries are available at [GitHub runc releases page](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases).

Install the corresponding file by replacing `<arch>` with `amd64` or `arm64`.

```shell
wget https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/download/v1.1.9/runc.<arch>
sudo install -m 755 runc.<arc> /usr/local/sbin/runc
```

## Install CNI plugins
@todo: not sure whether this is required. need to verify

## Configure Cgroups

Cgroups are a Linux kernel feature which allows you to allocate CPU, memory and network bandwidth to processes runnning in the system. Containerd uses Cgroups to limit the CPU and meory allocation to cotaines.

```shell
containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml > /dev/null
```
In the config.toml, change `SystemdCgroup = false` to `SystemdCgroup = true`.

```shell
sudo sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/g' /etc/containerd/config.toml 
```

Restart `containerd` for the configuration to take effect.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart containerd.service
```


# Install kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl

`kubeadm` is the tool we are using for creating the cluster. 

`kubelet` is an agent that runs on each node in the Kubernetes cluster.

`kubectl` is the CLI tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. We do not have to install `kubectl` on the same node that we install Kubernetes. But for this test lab let's install `kubectl` also on the same server.

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg
curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

# Initialize cluster

Create `kubeadm-config.yml`
```yaml
kind: ClusterConfiguration
apiVersion: kubeadm.k8s.io/v1beta3
kubernetesVersion: v1.29.0
networking:
  serviceSubnet: "10.96.0.0/16"
  podSubnet: "192.168.0.0/16"
  dnsDomain: "cluster.local"
---
kind: KubeletConfiguration
apiVersion: kubelet.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
cgroupDriver: systemd
```

Initialize cluster.
```shell
sudo kubeadm init --config kubeadm-init.yml
```


# Configure kubectl

At the time of installation `kubeadm` creates `kubeconfig` file in `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`. `kubectl` uses this file for connecting to the cluster so copy it to `.kube` in the home directory.

```shell
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

Run `kubectl`.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   coredns-76f75df574-n9zr5        0/1     Pending   0          5m25s
kube-system   coredns-76f75df574-ssqv4        0/1     Pending   0          5m25s
kube-system   etcd-k8s30                      1/1     Running   1          5m40s
kube-system   kube-apiserver-k8s30            1/1     Running   0          5m40s
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-k8s30   1/1     Running   0          5m40s
kube-system   kube-proxy-2ttxz                1/1     Running   0          5m25s
kube-system   kube-scheduler-k8s30            1/1     Running   1          5m40s
```

`kubeadm` has completed its job of deploying the cluster. But, `coredns` plugins are still not running because our cluster still does not have a CNI plg

# Install CNI plugin

Kubernetes depends on CNI plugins to implement network connectivty between Pods. There are several network plugins available but we'll choose Calico for this test lab.

```shell
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.4/manifests/tigera-operator.yaml
```

Check the status of all Pods after installing the CNI.

```shell
$ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE         NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system       coredns-76f75df574-n9zr5           0/1     Pending   0          24m
kube-system       coredns-76f75df574-ssqv4           0/1     Pending   0          24m
kube-system       etcd-k8s30                         1/1     Running   1          25m
kube-system       kube-apiserver-k8s30               1/1     Running   0          25m
kube-system       kube-controller-manager-k8s30      1/1     Running   0          25m
kube-system       kube-proxy-2ttxz                   1/1     Running   0          24m
kube-system       kube-scheduler-k8s30               1/1     Running   1          25m
tigera-operator   tigera-operator-7f8cd97876-k4b92   1/1     Running   0          9m31s
```

Note the status of the `coredns` Pods.
