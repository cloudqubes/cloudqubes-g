In this tutorial, we will deploy a Kubernetes cluster on your laptop and get your hands dirty.

## System requirements

You need a Linux, Mac(Intel or Apple Silicon), or Windows laptop with at least 6GB of memory to complete this tutorial.


## Outline of steps
1. Install Multipass
Install K0s
2. Install and use kubectl
3. Create a Pod
5. Introduction to Kubernetes API objects
8. What's next

# Install Multipass

We are going to install a Kubernetes cluster on a virtual machine on your laptop. We use Multipass to create the virtual machine. Multipass is a tool for running Ubuntu virtual machines on Linux, Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon), or Windows.

Install Multipass by following the installation instructions.

# Install K0s

## Launch a new virtual machine

Open the terminal on your laptop.
Launch a new virtual machine named `k0s10` with 5GB storage, 2GB memory, and 2 CPU cores. We use [Ubuntu Jammy](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/) OS. 
```shell{outputLines: 2}
multipass launch -d 5G -m 2G -c 2 -n k0s10 22.04
```

Log in to the virtual machine.
```shell{outputLines: 2}
multipass shell k0s10
```
This virtual machine is the host for our K0s cluster.

## Install K0s

On the virtual machine `k0s10`, run the K0s installation script to download the latest K0s version and install it to `/usr/local/bin`. The script will detect your CPU architecture (`amd64` or `arm64`) and download the appropriate binary of K0s.

```shell{outputLines: 2}
curl -sSLf https://get.k0s.sh | sudo sh
```

Run `k0s` as a service.
```shell{outputLines: 2}
sudo k0s install controller --single
```

Start `k0s`.

```shell{outputLines: 2}
sudo k0s start
```

Check the status of `k0s` service with `systemctl`.
```shell{outputLines: 2}
sudo systemctl status k0scontroller.service 
```
The service should be in `active` state.

Check `k0s` status with `k0s status` command.
```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
 sudo k0s status
Version: v1.28.4+k0s.0
Process ID: 1887
Role: controller
Workloads: true
SingleNode: true
Kube-api probing successful: true
Kube-api probing last error: 
```
We have installed Kubernetes 1.28 version.

Now we have a Kubernetes cluster... up and running.

Kubernetes is an open-source project. It's written in Go language. The code is hosted on a GitHub repo. The Kubernetes project also releases binaries of Kubernetes which you can install by following their installation instructions. But, that's bit lenghthy. So we chose to install K0s instead. K0s is a Kubernetes distribution from Mirantis. K0s includes a set of installation scripts that makes is quite easy to install. While it's bundled in a different way, k0s cluster implements all the features of a vanilla Kubernetes. 

There are many Kubernetes distributions from vendors like Canonical, RedHat, Suse, etc. Most of those Kubernetes distributions are intended to be installed on multiple servers on a data center. Since we are installing Kubernetes on a laptop, we chose K0s. 

K0s is a lighweight Kubernetes distribution intended to be installed on resource-constrained environments like laptops. 

# Use kubectl

Our Kubernetes cluster is ready. O interact with Kubernetes cluster, there is a tool `kubectl`. The `kubectl` tool is developed separately from the main Kubernetes softeare. But the version of `kubectl` must match the version of Kubernetes running in the cluster.

Since we have installed Kubernetes `1.28` version, let's install the same version of `kubectl`.

The `kubectl` binaries are available for both `amd64` and `arm64` architecture. Download the appropriate architecture for your platform by replacing <arch> with either `amd64` or `arm64`.

```shell
curl -LO https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.28.0/bin/linux/<arch>/kubectl
```

If you are unsure of what acrchitecrue your Ubuntu virtual machine you can check with `dpkg --print-architecture` command.

Install `kubectl`.
```shell
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Verify that you've successfully installed `kubectl`.

```shell
kubectl version --client
Client Version: v1.28.0
Kustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3
```

`kubectl` need to know the URL and authentication information of the cluster. By default `kubectl` look for these information in `~./kube/config`. This file is also known as the `kubeconfig` file.

For our Kubernetes cluster, we can generate a `kubeconfig` file.

```shell
sudo k0s kubeconfig admin > ~/.kube/config
```

Print the nodes in the cluster.
```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get nodes 
NAME    STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
k0s10   Ready    control-plane   15h   v1.28.4+k0s
```

We have just one node in the cluster. 

# Kubectl commands

List Pods
```shell
$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```

A namespace is a logical isolation in Kubernetes.

List the namespaces.

```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
kube-system       Active   15h
kube-public       Active   15h
kube-node-lease   Active   15h
default           Active   15h
k0s-autopilot     Active   15h
```

List Pods running in all the namespaces in the cluster.

```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   kube-proxy-zlnnv                  1/1     Running   0          15h
kube-system   kube-router-dxl8m                 1/1     Running   0          15h
kube-system   coredns-85df575cdb-wzq96          1/1     Running   0          15h
kube-system   metrics-server-7556957bb7-4z4rj   1/1     Running   0          15h
```

The Pods in the `kube-system` namespace belong to Kubernetes control plane.

The get command retrieves a Kubernetes API object.

List all API object types.
```shell
kubectl api-resources
```

This prints a lengthy list of API resources available in Kubernetes. Read the list to find the `node`, `pod`, `namespace` all are API objects in Kubernetes.

# Create a Pod

A Pod is a deplloyable unit in Kubernetes. A Pod runs one or more containers. A software application running on Kubernetes essentially a collection of Pods.

Let's create a Pod of an Nginx web server.
```shell
kubectl run nginx-app --image=nginx --port=80
```
This command download the container image Nginx from Docker Hub and runs a single Pod in the `default` namespace. The `port` parameter specified the port that the Pod is listening on.

List the Pod.
```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get pods
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-app   1/1     Running   0          97s
```

List more detials.
```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-app   1/1     Running   0          2m50s   10.244.0.5   k0s10   <none>           <none>
```

The `o` flag with value `wide` prints some extended details aboit the Pod. The key parameterthat we get here is the Pod IP address.

Kubernetes assigns every Pod an IP address that's unique within the cluster.

Let's create a second Pod. An object in Kubernetes must have a unique name, so we update the name as `nginx-app-2`.

```shell
kubectl run nginx-app-2 --image=nginx --port=80 
```

List the Pods.
```shell{outputLines: 2-10}
kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE     IP           NODE    NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-app     1/1     Running   1 (11m ago)   6h30m   10.244.0.6   k0s10   <none>           <none>
nginx-app-2   1/1     Running   0             4s      10.244.0.9   k0s10   <none>           <none>
```

The Pods are assigned with unique IP addresses. These IP addresses are internal to the cluster. 

Our Pods are running Nginx web servers. To test the Nginx web server with `curl` we can use port forwarding. 

```shell
kubectl port-forward pod/nginx-app 4000:80
```

The `port-forward` command does not return immediately. So open a second terminal and test the web server with curl.

```shell{outputLines: 2-20}
curl 127.0.0.1:4000
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to nginx!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx.</em></p>
</body>
</html>
```

In the terminal where the `port-forward` command is running press `Ctrl+c` to stop the running command.

Delete a Pod.

```shell
kubectl delete pod nginx-app-2
```
